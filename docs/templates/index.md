# Welcome to AutoRec

## Abstract

Realistic recommender systems are often required to adapt to ever-changing
data and tasks or to explore different models systematically.
To address the need, we present **AutoRec**, an open-source automated machine
learning (AutoML) platform extended from the TensorFlow ecosystem and, to our
knowledge, the first framework to leverage AutoML for model search and
hyperparameter tuning in deep recommendation models.

AutoRec also supports a highly flexible pipeline that accommodates both sparse
and dense inputs, rating prediction and click-through rate (CTR) prediction
tasks, and an array of recommendation models.
Lastly, AutoRec provides a simple, user-friendly API.

Experiments conducted on the benchmark datasets reveal AutoRec is reliable and
can identify models which resemble the best model without prior knowledge.
